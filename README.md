# Smart-Light-System

This Arduino project focuses on creating a smart street light system employing IR sensors and Light Detecting Resistors (LDRs). The LDR plays a crucial role in detecting light levels by adjusting its resistance based on the ambient light intensity. Additionally, an IR sensor is utilized to identify the presence of a vehicle, ensuring that the streetlight activates only during nighttime when a vehicle is detected by the IR sensor.
